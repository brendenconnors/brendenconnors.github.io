Hello! Here is a little about me.

### **Background**

I am from Montana in the United States, but currently living in Sacramento, California.

I received both my degrees in Montana. I received my BS in mathematics in 2019 from the Montana State University - Billings and MS in data science in 2021 from the University of Montana. 

### **Work**

I currently work for the Sacramento Kings of the National Basketball Association as a data scientist.

I previously worked for [Symend](https://symend.com/) as a machine learning engineer. I  worked for Symend as a data science intern, data scientist, and ML engineer in some capacity since May 2020 until November 2022.

Prior to that, I worked various jobs during school, some better than others. I particularly enjoyed being a farmhand for 3 years and coaching basketball. 

### **What interests do I have?**

Like most people working with data, I have a strong interest in machine learning. I have experience with both traditional statistical learning techniques and deep learning. However, the field is very broad, changing rapidly, and full of people much smarter than I, so I try to learn something new as often as I can. Lately, I have been trying to improve my software engineering type skills, to become a little more well rounded.
