Hello! Here is a little about me.

### **Where am I from?**

I am from Montana  in the United States, but currently living in Richmond, Virginia.

### **What is my current situation/employment?**

I currently work for [Symend](https://symend.com/) as a Machine Learning Engineer. I have worked for Symend as both a data science intern and data scientist in some capacity since May 2020.

Prior to that, I worked various jobs during school, some better than others. I particularly enjoyed being a farmhand for 3 years and coaching basketball. I am still looking to find a second data-scientist/farmhand/basketball coach. There must be at least one more out there!

### **Where did I receive my education?**

I received both my degrees in Montana. I received my BS in mathematics in 2019 from the Montana State University - Billings and MS in data science in 2021 from the University of Montana. At some point in the future, if I am so lucky, I may return to school to pursue a PhD.

### **What interests do I have?**

Like most people working with data, I have a strong interest in machine learning. I have experience with both traditional statistical learning techniques and deep learning. However, the field is very broad, changing rapidly, and full of people much smarter than I, so I try to learn something new as often as I can.

In addition to machine learning I have an interest/admiration for data visualization. I am a great admirer of work done by [Kirk Goldsberry](https://www.kirkgoldsberry.com/) and visualizations done by the [FiveThirtyEight team](https://fivethirtyeight.com/)

### **What do I want to learn/improve?**

In many personal blogs/websites I rarely see authors posting about things that they want to learn. I believe adding these has 3 benefits. First, it holds myself accountable to actually learning these things if it is posted publicly. Second, others may offer best resources to learn or lessons learned while exploring the topic. Lastly, it may lessen impostor syndrome (guilty) for many people that are learning, as it shows that most people still have lots to learn.
