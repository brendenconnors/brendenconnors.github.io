Over the past decade or two, the number of international players in the NBA has increased dramatically. In today's NBA, it is not uncommon to see a lineup of five players on the floor containing two or three internationally born players. International players seem to account for a larger and larger portion of the total NBA each year. This is probably a result of the rise in the popularity of basketball around the globe, the internet, and increased scouting.

The graphic below shows the birthplaces of foreign born NBA players plotted at the time of their **introduction** into the NBA/ABA. The coloring of MPG (minutes per game) looks to represent their importance/talent while in the league, as more important/talented players usually receive more minutes. Hover over points for more info about each player.

Note: Small random values are added to each player's home location to avoid overlaying of points. Looking at you Ljubljana!
