title: Miami Heat Passing Sequences
layout: projects
---

**Hypothesis**: Longer passing sequences result in successful possesions more often than shorter sequences. This visualization represents all passing sequences initialized by Jimmy Butler of the Miami Heat against the LA Lakers in game 5 of the 2020 NBA Finals. The player who initializes the possesion is the player who brings the ball past half court or inbounds the ball in the frontcourt. Only possesions initialized by Jimmy Butler are shown here. Jimmy Butler accounted for 73.3% of all initializations.Summary statistics by passing layer are shown. For example, FGA for the 1st pass layer represents the number of Field Goals Attempted for all players who received the first pass in a passing sequence. All data recorded **manually** from game 5 of 2020 NBA Finals and can be found [here](https://github.com/brendenconnors/HW4-Network).
